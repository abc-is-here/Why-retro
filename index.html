          Mario jumps with a sound 'poing' and well old people love it! But
          nowadays what everyone seeks is realism, everyone needs those leaves
          crunching footstep sounds and gun in hand.

          An appla a day keeps the doctor away! Snake was a game that taught us
          to eat healthy and grow. But now we have games that teach us to shoot
          and kill, games that teach us to be a bad person.

          Tetris was a game that taught us how to fit in, how to be perfect, how
          to be a part of the society. But now we have games that teach us to
          break the rules, games that teach us to be a rebel.

        Retro games were not just games, they were a way of life, a way of
        thinking, a way of being. They taught us values, they taught us how to
        be a better person. But now we have games that teach us to be a bad
        person, games that teach us to be a rebel.
      </p>
      <p>So let's go back to the days when life was retro!</p>
